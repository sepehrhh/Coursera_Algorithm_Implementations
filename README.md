# Introduction 
The repository contains implementations of programming challenges on Algorithms on Strings https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings, Algorithms on Graphs https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs and Advanced Algorithms and Complexity https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity courses provided by Coursera in C#.


# UnitTesting
All of the assignments have unit tests written with MSTest2. The TestCommon library has been developed by Dr Sauleh Eetemadi https://github.com/sauleh to process test data of each assignment which is in A#Tests/TestData/.. folder in each VS solution.
